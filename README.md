At the beginning of my learning as an AI-oriented developer, I knew nothing about the Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. In order to practice using them, I launched the challenge to rework the code in Python of existing Bezier curve algorithms (fitting et construct). I particularly focused on the use of Numpy and possible code improvements, I had to make it cleaner and more efficient. This has been a big work of retroingenuity and reconstruction. As you can imagine, whether the results are the ones expected, the original algorithmic approach and the code finally produced have nothing more comparable. 

Once done, I started dynamic display with Matplotlib animation for one function and its equivalence in Bézier curve. During the display of this function, I also display graphically all the parameters applied for the Bézier curves (see Bezier Result). The challenge in this case was to obtain a graphical representation so that these parameters scroll as an oscilloscope (see Histo Control).
